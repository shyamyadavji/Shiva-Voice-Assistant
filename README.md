## üåü Key Features

-   **üé§ Advanced Noise Reduction:** Utilizes `noisereduce` to clean microphone audio in real-time, significantly improving command recognition accuracy in noisy environments.
-   **üß† Hybrid Command Engine:** Instantly handles predefined local commands (e.g., "open Notepad") for speed and falls back seamlessly to a powerful generative AI for complex or unknown queries.
-   **ü§ñ Generative AI Integration:** Powered by **Google's Gemini** for robust natural language understanding, Q&A, weather reports, fun facts, and more.
-   **üíª Direct System Control:** Open local applications, files (PDF, DOCX), and play local media (music, videos). Can even extract file paths directly from voice commands.
-   **üåê Web & Information Access:** Open websites, search Google, and fetch summaries from Wikipedia.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   Git command-line tool
-   A working microphone and speakers

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyamyadavji/Shiva-Voice-Assistant.git
    cd Shiva-Voice-Assistant
    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment**
    It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies cleanly.
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your Environment File**
    This is a crucial step to securely store your API key.
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your Google AI API key:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    -   *This file is intentionally ignored by Git and will not be uploaded, keeping your key safe.*
